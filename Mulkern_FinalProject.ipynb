A diagnosis of this disease is heartbreaking not only for the patient but also for their families, because this means that over time, the patient will slowly lose touch with the world around them and might even stop recognizing their loved ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "Brain scans of Alzheimer's and dementia patients indicate loss of white matter volume, deteriorated neuronal connections, and a buildup of amyloid plaques. Taken all together, the patients exhibit symptoms such as short-term memory loss, general forgetfulness, increasing dependence on caregivers, speech loss, and other coordination problems.\n",

    "Although a drug called Aduhelm was recently approved to be fast-tracked by the FDA as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease (https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-alzheimers-drug), the evidence for the effectiveness of the drug is not overwhelmingly positive, and at best, the drug will only slow down the deterioration. \n",
